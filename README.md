# ARM Project Template

This template was developed for the Stellaris/Tivia Launchpad boards from TI, but should work with other targets and kits.

## Requirements

This template requires an ARM cross compiler toolchain such as Mentor Graphics CodeSourcery. This can be installed several ways. I reccomend jsnyder's [arm-eabi-toolchain](https://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain)
